## Description

InControl is an input manager for Unity3D that standardizes input mappings across various platforms for common controllers.

Documentation is available at: [http://www.gallantgames.com/incontrol](http://www.gallantgames.com/incontrol)

InControl is also [available on the Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/6mr) for a modest price. If you find this project beneficial, please consider supporting its ongoing development. You'll have the convenience of easy installation and updates right from the Unity Editor.

As development continues, a few additional "pro" features will be available on the Asset Store only, and will not be open sourced in the repository.

Current features available only in the Asset Store include:

* [Touch controls](http://www.gallantgames.com/pages/incontrol-touch-controls).
* OUYA Everywhere SDK support.
* `InControlInputModule` component for new Unity GUI integration.

## Features

* Support [many common controllers and platforms](http://www.gallantgames.com/pages/incontrol-supported-controllers) with ease.
* Create virtual devices from keyboard and mouse input with [custom profiles](http://www.gallantgames.com/pages/incontrol-keyboard-mouse).
* [Touch controls](http://www.gallantgames.com/pages/incontrol-touch-controls) as a virtual device feeds right into the existing controller API ([Asset Store](http://u3d.as/6mr) only).
* Events for attached and detached devices.
* Events for active device switches.

## Branches and Releases

Currently InControl has two branches: `master` is considered the more stable branch, while `develop` is the cutting-edge branch. Any pull requests should be made on `develop`.

[Tagged releases](https://github.com/pbhogan/InControl/releases) coincide with official Asset Store versions, minus any "pro" features.

## License

You may use InControl, modified or unmodified, in any and all games that you create for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. However, in the spirit of this being an open source project, it is expressly forbidden to sell or commercially distribute InControl apart from your games. It may under no circumstances be repackaged or included in any plugin sold on the Unity Asset Store or elsewhere, whether in source or DLL form. No exceptions.
